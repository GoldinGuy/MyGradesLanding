									<h3>2. PRIVACY.</h3>
								</div>
								<div class="policy-details">
									<p>
										This privacy policy covers the services accessed using
										MyGrades. MyGrades is an unofficial tool that provides
										students/parents timely access to student information
										including, but not limited to grades, discipline, and
										attendance.<strong>
											Swiftgrade does not store or alter student data in any
											way.</strong
										>
										Students can access MyGrades through their school or
										school district’s “District Portal” username and password.
										<br /><br />This Privacy Policy describes MyGrades’s
										privacy practices in relation to information pulled from
										Student Information Systems through the software
										applications made available by us for use on or through
										mobile devices that link to this Privacy Policy (the
										<strong>“App”</strong>).</p>
										<h3>Information We Collect</h3>
									<p>	<br />“Personal Information” is information that identifies
										you as an individual or relates to an identifiable
										individual.
										<strong
											>No student information is collected by
											MyGrades.</strong
										>
										MyGrades keeps a student’s username and password in Local
										Storage Objects (LSOs) on their device to speed up future
										authentication, but <u>no data</u> ever leaves the device
										for servers accessible by MyGrades.</p> 
										<h3>Tracking Technologies</h3>
										<br />
									<p>	<strong>
											Cookies, Beacons, and other Similar Technologies:</strong
										>
										Technologies such as cookies, beacons, tags and scripts are
										used by MyGrades. These technologies are used to make it
										easier for you to navigate our app and to store your
										password so you don’t have to enter it more than
										once.<strong> <br /><br />Local Storage Objects:</strong> We
										use Local Storage Objects (LSOs) to store your username and
										password for a quicker login experience. </p><h3>Third Party Service
										Providers</h3><br> <p>We work with a third party service provider to
										help improve the quality of our service. This third party
										does not share your information with any other third
										parties. MyGrades uses the following third party service
										on the App: <br><br><strong>Flutter Sentry </strong>- Flutter Sentry is a library
										used to report errors thrown by our app to an error tracking
										service. This allows our developer team to continue to
										improve and refine the user experience. Sentry.io is open
										source and can be viewed at
										https://github.com/flutter/sentry. Sentry.io does not share
										user information with any other third parties.</p> <h3>Changes to
                    this Privacy Policy </h3><br>
                    <p>If we decide to change our privacy
										policy, we will post those changes to this statement and
										other places we deem appropriate. We reserve the right to
										modify this statement at any time, so please review it
										frequently. You understand that through your use of the
										Products, you consent to the use (as set forth in this
										Agreement, the Privacy Policy) of your information for
										processing by MyGrades.</p>
